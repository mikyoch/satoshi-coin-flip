          We present an implementation of the{" "}

            Sui blockchain

          MIST stake. This is implemented on{" "}

        <p className="pt-2">
          For each game, the player generates a random secret. A user can
          then play by staking the fixed amount we&apos;ve defined - 5000 MIST - and
          selects <span className="underline underline-offset-4">Head</span> or{" "}
          <span className="underline underline-offset-4">Tails</span>. The game
          then ends and the winner is selected. Throughout the entire game,
          everyone can see the hash of the secret. One can validate the secret
          from the end-game transaction: by simply hashing, it they can ensure
          that it was a fair game.
